## Technical test

### Ten Pin Bowling

Write a web application that lets you â€œplayâ€ ten pin bowling

It should let you choose a number of players (1-4), then and implement the rules of play as
defined here:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-pin_bowling#Rules_of_play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-pin_bowling#Rules_of_play)

Each frame should:

1. Display the current scores, and the scores of all previous frames
2. Let each player take the right number of shots
3. Let you enter the number of pins knocked down in each shot

At the end of the game, it should

1. Display the final scores
2. Declare the winner

This should not take longer than an hour or two - Weâ€™re primarily looking for clean, well-organised
code and a sensible approach.

Happy coding!


Rules of the game:

Bowling Rules:

10 turns allowed per game.
2 rolls allowed per turn.
If bowler fails to knock both down, score for that turn is sum of its rolls rolls.
Spare: bowler knocks down 10 on roll #2. Score is 10 + next roll score.
Strike: bowler knocks down 10 on roll #1. Score is 10 + next 2 throw scores.
Spare or strike on last turn (turn 10), gets 1 or 2 bonus rolls respectively. These bonus rolls count toward the 10th turn.
